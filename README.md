👋 Hello, I’m Kellen

I’m a U.S. Army veteran and a full-time Computer Science student passionate about building things that matter. My current focus is developing my Java and Python skills, with growing interests in video game development, physics-based simulations, and applied problem-solving.

⚙️ Current Interests • Building desktop apps using Java (Swing/JavaFX) • Developing tools that solve everyday problems • Exploring the intersection of physics and code (like simulation and automation) • Improving my software engineering skills with real projects

🌱 Currently Learning • Advanced Java concepts and GUI development • Data structures and algorithms • Git and collaborative workflows • Intro to scripting and automation with Python

🧠 What Drives Me • I’m motivated by problem-solving, creating useful tools, and learning how things work under the hood. In the long term, I’m interested in roles that blend software with science, education, and human-centered design.

🎯 Goals • Build software that solves real-world problems • Contribute to open-source projects focused on accessibility, education, or sustainability • Transition into a professional software engineering or game development role
